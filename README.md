# Recommender_System

# To Do:

## Datasets Folder
-> Insert News Artciles Comma perated Value Files (csv files)

## Preprocessing Folder
-> make a python script to stack all news Artciles 
-> make a python file to scrape new news articles from assignment1.py files and combine them with previous articles
-> make a python file to filter the news artciles to only leave news artciles from last 7 days and save it as useful_news.py

-> Make a News_processing.ipynb, preprocessing for article profiling
-> Make a Artcile_Profiling.ipynb , using Document Embeddings and Time Embeddings to make article Profiles


**After Implementation and testing, make python scripts for each in scripts folder**

#### Similarily
-> Make a Users_preprocessing.ipynb
-> Make a User_Profiling.ipynb

## techniques
### filtering folders
-> Implement Content Based, Collaborative and Hybrid Filtering Technqiues in a notebook
Use Profiles and data previosuly generated
